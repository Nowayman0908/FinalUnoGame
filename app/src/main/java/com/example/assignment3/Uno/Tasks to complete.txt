Tasks to be done:
1) Major bugs need to be fixed as listed on the Github UnoBeta page. (https://github.com/Nowayman0908/UnoGameBeta/issues)
2) The AI needs to be reworked to not crash upon a specific case.
3) GUI needs to be enhanced to look better.
4) Additional feature need to be added, a sort button that sorts the hand between Color and Number, etc.
Most importantly we need to make sure the game is as bug free as possible.
